# I love creating software. 13 years up to now.

Started from `Delphi` and `C++ Builder`, got involved into the .NET-development from the times of `.NET 1.0` up until now. Since then, `C#` is my old best friend. Tons of code written,  mostly in `Visual Studio`, using `Windows Forms` and `ASP.NET WebForms`, `WPF` and `Silverlight`, `Windows Phone` and `Windows 10`, `ASP.NET MVC` and `ASP.NET Core`.

I have everlasting romance with functional languages. Had fun with `F#`, `Scala`, `Elm`, even some `Haskell`. But day-to-day functional experience goes from `C#`, heavily using `Linq` and other libs like my [`Functional.Maybe`](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/Functional.Maybe).

The `TypeScript`'s appearance changed my relationships with the frontend. Now it is another home environment for me. Contemporary frontend technologies are  very inspiring, so through `Backbone`, `Knockout` &c I shifted to `React` & `MobX`, trying to build more concise and modular components.

And all the traditional stuff, of course - relational databases (`MSSQL`), queue services (`RabbitMQ` & others), nosql storages (`ElasticSearch` & others).
