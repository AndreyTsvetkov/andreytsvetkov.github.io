# I love creating software. 13 years up to now.

Started from Delphi and C++ Builder, got involved into the .NET-development from the times of .NET 1.0 up until now. Since then, C# is my old best friend. Tons of code written,  mostly in Visual Studio, from oldschool WinForms and WebForms, WPF and Silverlight to Windows Phone and Windows 10, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core.

I have everlasting romance with functional languages. Had fun with F#, Scala, Elm, even some Haskell. But day-to-day functional experience goes from C#, heavily using Linq and other libs like my [Functional.Maybe](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/Functional.Maybe).

The TypeScript's appearance changed my relationships with the frontend. Now it is another home environment for me. Contemporary frontend technologies are  very inspiring, so through Backbone, Knockout &c I shifted to React & MobX, trying to build more concise and modular components.

And all the traditional stuff, of course - relational databases (MSSQL), queue services (RabbitMQ & others), nosql storages (ElasticSearch & others). 

## My projects

### Functional.Maybe | [github](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/Functional.Maybe) | ![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8e2bdbu4q60vu2o5?svg=true) | [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Functional.Maybe/)

This library introduces the Maybe<T> type (like F-languages Option type), closely integrated into .net ecosystem, including linq query syntax. Rich extension API allows to write declarative code in many scenarios where previously you needed a tree of if-else statements. 

### fast-nuget-update | [github](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/fast-nuget-update ) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ckwopqwiws29cxmn?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AndreyTS/fast-nuget-update) | [download](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/fast-nuget-update/releases)

Simple tool to bulk update nuget package references for Visual Studio projects (useful for huge solutions).
